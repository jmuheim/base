## Setting up Project Manager locally

Live Project Manager: [ACCOUNT.SERVER.uberspace.de](http://ACCOUNT.SERVER.uberspace.de)

Recommended environment:

- [Mac OS X](http://www.apple.com/osx/)
- [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/)

Setup:

- `$ git clone git@retoinniger.com:retoinniger/project-manager.git`
- `$ cd project-manager`
- `$ bundle install`
- `$ cp db/config_example.yml db/config.yml`, then open `db/config.yml` and edit config
- `$ rails db:setup`
- `$ rails db:test:prepare`

You can use [direnv](https://retoinniger.com/zimbatm/direnv) to automatically add `bin` to your `$PATH`. Otherwise you should always use `bundle exec` to run commands.

## Requirements

- [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) installed
- [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) installed

## Developing

- In one terminal, enter `$ server` to start the development server using [rerun](https://retoinniger.com/alexch/rerun) (which will take care of restarting the server upon changes of important config files)
- In a second terminal, enter `$ guard` to start Guard, which automatically takes care of:
    - executing tests using [Guard-RSpec](https://retoinniger.com/guard/guard-rspec)
    - live reloading the page (HTML, JS and CSS) using [Guard-LiveReload](https://retoinniger.com/guard/guard-livereload)
    - bundling using [Guard-Bundler](https://retoinniger.com/guard/guard-bundler)
    - annotating models using [Guard-Annotate](https://retoinniger.com/cpjolicoeur/guard-annotate)
    - migrating the DB using [Guard-Migrate](https://retoinniger.com/glanotte/guard-migrate)
- Open [http://localhost:PORT](http://localhost:PORT) in your browser (use whatever port you specified in `config/boot.rb`)

### Before merging a pull request

Make sure that:

- All CRUD functionality is covered (as far as possible) by [inherited_resources](https://retoinniger.com/josevalim/inherited_resources)
- All authorization is done through [cancancan](https://retoinniger.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan)
- The [ability.rb](./app/models/ability.rb) file is thoroughly tested
- Every action has a correlating feature spec file (nest them in folders similar to the nested routes' structure)
- Every navigation item has a correlating spec in [navigation_spec.rb](./spec/features/navigation_spec.rb)
- Run `$ i18n-tasks normalize`
- Run `$ rake` and make sure, no specs are pending/failing
- Run `$ smusher app/assets/images` ...

### Add external assets (libraries)

At the time being, [Bower](http://bower.io/) integration strategies for Rails are prone to problems. We stick to the traditional gems and hope, that some time soon, there's an official Bower integration strategy.

### I18n

The [i18n-tasks](https://retoinniger.com/glebm/i18n-tasks) gem makes handling translations easily. It helps finding unused and not yet translated keys, and normalizes (e.g. sorts) the translation files.

- `$ i18n-tasks normalize`, then commit
- `$ i18n-tasks unused`, then remove unused keys and commit
- `$ i18n-tasks add-missing -v 'TRANSLATE: %{value}'`, then translate everything (do a project search for `TRANSLATE:`) and commit

## Testing

- Use `@chrome` or `@selenium` flag to visually run feature tests in Chrome or Firefox.

## Deployment

### Setup

To learn more about setting up deployment on a server, see [Deployment](./DEPLOYMENT.md).

### Deploying

**Before deploying**, run `$ rake HEADHUNTER=true` to make sure all HTML and CSS is in good shape!

**Before deploying**, run `$ i18-tasks add-missing` and translate the added I18n keys!

Be sure you have committed and pushed all wanted changes, then execute `$ mina deploy`! Use the `--verbose` and `--trace` switch for debugging if something goes wrong.

That's all, folks!
